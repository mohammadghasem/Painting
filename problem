Ali wants to color all the cells of an n*m table.
At first, none of the houses in the table are colored,
and at each step he chooses a new color (that he has not used so far) like x,
and after choosing a row or column, he changes the color of all its houses to x.
He did this and in the end every house is one of the colors 1 to 10000.

#input
